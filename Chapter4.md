The GALZ were in a frozen tundra!
It was so cold, and in the distance they saw penguins.
They were cute pudgy penguins that needed their help from poachers.
The GALZ said "Do not worry- we shall help you."
The GALZ proceeded to get rid of the poachers with their badass combat skills.
Finally, they left.
The penguins said "Thank you GALZ."
And the penguins lived in peace.
