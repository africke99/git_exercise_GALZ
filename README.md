GALZ Club

A bunch of crazy galz going on an adventure. Each chapter there is a unexpected change of events...

Grace: The Galz were walking home together one night and all of a sudden the ground started to crack and there was lava on the floor. They had to attempt parkour to get back home.

Augusta: The Galz get stranded in the middle of a lake on a floaty.

Lila: The Galz were in a helicopter that was about to explode so they had to parachute out

Zully:The Galz were in a frozen tundra and they had to save a species of penguins that were going extinct.
