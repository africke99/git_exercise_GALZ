The Galz thought that a relaxing hellicopter ride would be a fun vacation activity,
but little did they know what would come to happen.
A mysterious bomb was discovered on the copter, 
so they had to get out as soon as possible!
Luckily, there was exactly 4 parachutes available for them to take.
So they quickly jumped from he copter to safety.
