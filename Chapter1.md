Chapter 1

The Galz were walking home together one night and all of a sudden the ground started to crack and there was lava on the floor. They had to attempt parkour to get back home. Never did they think that their favorite game of "The Floor is Lava" would come to life and appear right before them. As they made hops left, right, and forward, they were able to safely cross over the area and not fall into the lava. With only one missing shoe, they were able to make it back home safely.
